    <h1>Michael's Resume</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I began my journey in the IT space tinkering with computers when I was in high school. I knew really nothing, but learned how to build my own computers with just a motherboard.
            I then started learning to code on my own with HTML. I found some site that taught the various commands and started to build my own site. I then joined a company starting off as tech support for the membership. I 
            eventually left the IT space for a little bit with a strong desire to return. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As such, I started going back to school to learn what I needed to learn. Then I joined a program called TEAMFIT where they taught me full stack java development. After the class, I landed on a data team where I built ETLS
            and big SQL queries, and remediated UDAs. After doing that for about 3-4 years. I was asked to help the UI team due to my experience in class. I agreed and quickly became a tech lead over the team. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am now in the process of transitioning over to a full stack web developer as the projects I built and provided support for are moving to a contract that will manage our applications.
